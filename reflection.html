<h2>Week 7: Reflections</h2>

  <p>My primary role for this group was project management. I coordinated the group resources and delegated tasks to team members. I solicited feedback and engagement from to group during planning stages,
  and attempted to align the weekly tasks with our planned application requirements. I also inserted myself as an individual contributor by writing code for some of these tasks.
  <p/>
  <p>
  The most significant problem we encountered was lack of communication or engagement from group members. We ultimately solved this problem by no longer delegating weekly tasks to them. 
  We wanted to provide them with ample opportunity to participate in the group, but it was coming at the cost of quality for our finished products. I believe that the 100% online collaboration setting can make it difficult to actively engage all group members.
  </p>
  <p>
  Personally, I thought it was interesting to build and see the interaction of the different moving pieces. (HTML, SQL, PHP, JSON...) 
  Being the in the role of project manager for the team was more challenging than I initially anticipated. Coordinating the efforts of multiple contributors remotely was not simple every week.
  </p>
  <p>
  I think that the experience of the group work and team dynamics was more valuable than the finished web application itself for this assignment. The skills of being a quality group team member and collaborating effectively will have applications and value beyond just server-side development.
  The cloud 9 platform was new to me prior to this course, but I can see it being a great tool for collaborative needs in the future. I think the portability of the workspace is a novel feature, being able to create/edit and compile code from anywhere.

	<p>My primary role for this group was web master. I was responsible for getting the page up on the web server and making sure it functioned properly there.<br>
	There are also multiple points where I was responsible for writing forms and testing code that others wrote to confirm that it worked properly.</p>
	
	<p>The main problems we encountered were difficulties in getting everyone to engage. We regularly did not get everything done in a week because we had people<br>
	assigned to tasks that were not around or were not starting their work until an hour before it was supposed to be finished. As a result, our site does not look<br>
	nearly as finished as it should.</p>
	
	<p>My main takeaway from this project was the realization of how do-able a big project like this can be with proper delegation. When all I have to worry is my own<br>
	little part, it's much less overwhelming to consider getting it all done.</p>
	
	<p>One thing I learned from working in a team was how important it is to be in constant communication. If you don't continue communicating, the group breaks down<br>
	and work does not get done properly.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>worked on the  race form (aminRace.php) which is used as the admin page to add or remove a race.</li>
        <li>created the work space on cloud 9   .</li>
        <li> made the layout and template of our web page  .</li>
        <li>I had the tester and validater role  some of the weeks I tested the site and validated the codes.</li>
       
    </ul>
    
 <p> The issues we faced was that we had new memebers joining the group late . It was very hard to get a hold of the new members and this delayed our weekly task 
     some weeks .</p>
 <p>  My takeaways was that I really enjoyed the idea generation stage of the project . Most of the project I spend my time on design this part of the project facinated me the most.
     Also it was really fun comparing the layout and designs to the final completed website .
